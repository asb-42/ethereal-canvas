# Output Directory

This directory contains generated and edited images from Ethereal Canvas.

## Structure
- `generated_*.png` - Text-to-image generation results
- `edited_*.png` - Image editing results  
- `inpainted_*.png` - Image inpainting results

## Usage
Images are automatically saved here when you use the Generate or Edit functions in the UI.

## Cleanup
Files can be safely deleted to save space. The application will continue working with an empty outputs directory.
